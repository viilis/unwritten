  pageText: "Didn\u2019t celebrate my birthday this year. But Kev sent me a handwritten
    letter. A letter. I teared up reading it.  \n\nI\u2019m such a stubborn idiot.
    I don\u2019t even care about what they said anymore\u2014it was probably just
    a dumb comment. But going back feels\u2026 embarrassing. What if they don\u2019t
    want me back? What if they hurt me again?  \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m
    fighting for anymore. Maybe I should just say sorry too. A part of me wants that
    so badly. But I\u2019m just too scared for it to happen all over again.  \n\nHappy
    birthday, I guess."
