  pageText: "It\u2019s been forever since I opened this. Guess who I saw on the street
    today? Good old John, Vivian and Kev. COVID and everything really messed up my
    sense of time, and of course, the one time I go out, I run into them.\nWhat else\u2026
    I don\u2019t know. The third book in the series isn\u2019t doing great. I guess
    now that the pandemic\u2019s over, people don\u2019t want to stay inside and
    read anymore.\nHonestly, though, I really thought the third one was my best work,
    but apparently, the world disagrees. Fuck."
