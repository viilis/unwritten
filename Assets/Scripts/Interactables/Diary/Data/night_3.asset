  pageText: "Found this diary while looking for scrap paper for story planning. It\u2019s
    been a while, so I figured I\u2019d write something.  \n\nLife is\u2026 not great.
    I\u2019ve been living on frozen pizza and delivery food, and honestly, I feel
    like a mess.\n\nTried therapy again last year, but it didn\u2019t work out for
    me. My fourth book? Barely better than the third. And the fifth one? It\u2019s
    five months overdue, and I\u2019m still completely stuck.\n\nAlso, Kev sent me
    a Christmas invite, and I said yes\u2026 though I think I was half-asleep when
    I did. Now I just feel this knot in my stomach\u2014nervous and unsure. I don\u2019t
    even know if I can face them, or HOW, I will face them.\n\nI just feel like I\u2019ve
    been stuck in the same place for years. And sometimes, I don\u2019t even know
    if I care anymore."
