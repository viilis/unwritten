  pageText: "What the actual hell is going on? COVID is insane. I thought it\u2019d
    blow over like a bad flu season, but now we\u2019re practically locked inside.
    The group and I have been coping with endless rounds of Valorant, League, and
    this silly new game called Among Us.  \n\nOh, and my first book comes out in
    two weeks! I\u2019m excited but also terrified it might flop because of this
    stupid pandemic."
