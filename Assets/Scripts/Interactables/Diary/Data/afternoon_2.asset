  pageText: "Happy birthday to me. It\u2019s been a whirlwind being 26.  \n\nSo,
    COVID happened, but the book still sold out! I\u2019m beyond proud of myself.
    Now it\u2019s back-to-back meetings and writing sessions. I\u2019ve always wanted
    this, and I don\u2019t want to be a one-hit wonder, so I\u2019m throwing myself
    into work. Honestly, quarantine makes it easier to tune everything else out. 
    \n\nBut\u2026 the group doesn\u2019t get it. Their sarcasm about me being \"unavailable\"
    is getting old. Like, I\u2019m sorry for chasing my dreams?\n"
